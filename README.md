Agile Methodologies is Iterative i.e an item can be recalled and also increemental while the Waterfall follows a sequuence of approach 
Agile is flexible and adapatable to changes. while Waterfall is Rigid 
There is Fast development experience in Agile 

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile:

Beneficial for software development projects where requirements are expected to evolve over time.
Example: Mobile app development where features are regularly updated based on user feedback.
Waterfall:

Ideal for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal changes.
Example: Building infrastructure software systems, like banking systems where compliance and security are critical.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
